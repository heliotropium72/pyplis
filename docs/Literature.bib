  Abstract                 = {{Bromine monoxide (BrO) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) abundances as a function of the distance from the source were measured by ground-based scattered light Multiaxis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) in the volcanic plumes of Mt. Etna on Sicily, Italy, in August - October 2004 and May 2005 and Villarica in Chile in November 2004. BrO and SO2 spatial distributions in a cross section of Mt. Etna's plume were also determined by Imaging DOAS. We observed an increase in the BrO/SO2 ratio in the plume from below the detection limit near the vent to about 4.5 x 10(-4) at 19 km (Mt. Etna) and to about 1.3 x 10(-4) at 3 km (Villarica) distance, respectively. Additional attempts were undertaken to evaluate the compositions of individual vents on Mt. Etna. Furthermore, we detected the halogen species ClO and OClO. This is the first time that OClO could be detected in a volcanic plume. Using calculated thermodynamic equilibrium compositions as input data for a one-dimensional photochemical model, we could reproduce the observed BrO and SO2 vertical columns in the plume and their ratio as function of distance from the volcano as well as vertical BrO and SO2 profiles across the plume with current knowledge of multiphase halogen chemistry, but only when we assumed the existence of an ``effective source region,{''} where volcanic volatiles and ambient air are mixed at about 600 degrees C (in the proportions of 60\% and 40\%, respectively).}},

  Abstract                 = {{The emission of volcanic gases usually precedes eruptive activity(1), providing both a warning signal and an indication of the nature of the lava soon to be erupted. Additionally, volcanic emissions are a significant source of gases and particles to the atmosphere, influencing tropospheric and stratospheric trace-gas budgets(2). Despite some halogen species having been measured in volcanic plumes(3) (mainly HCl and HF), little is known about bromine compounds(4) and, in particular, gas-phase reactive bromine species. Such species are especially important in the stratosphere(5), as reactive bromine - despite being two orders of magnitude less abundant than chlorine - accounts for about one-third of halogen-catalysed ozone depletion(6). In the troposphere, bromine-catalysed complete ozone destruction has been observed to occur regularly during spring in the polar boundary layers(7-11) as well as in the troposphere above the Dead Sea basin(12). Here we report observations of BrO and SO2 abundances in the plume of the Soufriere Hills volcano ( Montserrat) in May 2002 by ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy. Our estimate of BrO emission leads us to conclude that local ozone depletion and small ozone `holes' may occur in the vicinity of active volcanoes, and that the amount of bromine emitted from volcanoes might be sufficiently large to play a role not only in the stratosphere, but also in tropospheric chemistry.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Using the scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography (SCIAMACHY) pre-flight model satellite spectrometer, gas-phase absorption spectra of the most important atmospheric trace gases (O-3, NO2, SO2, O-2, OClO, H2CO, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, and N2O) have been measured in the 230-2380 nm range at medium spectral resolution and at several temperatures between 203 and 293 K. The spectra show high signal-to-noise ratio (between 200 up to a few thousands), high baseline stability (better than 10(-2)) and an accurate wavelength calibration (better than 0.01 nm) and were scaled to absolute absorption cross-sections using previously published data. The results are important as reference data for atmospheric remote-sensing and physical chemistry. Amongst other results, the first measurements of the Wulf bands of O-3 up to their origin above 1000 nm were made at five different temperatures between 203 and 293 K, the first UV-Vis absorption cross-sections of NO2 in gas-phase equilibrium at 203 K were recorded, and the ultraviolet absorption cross-sections of SO2 were measured at five different temperatures between 203 and 296 K. In addition, the molecular absorption spectra were used to improve the wavelength calibration of the SCIAMACHY spectrometer and to characterize the instrumental line shape (ILS) and straylight properties of the instrument. It is demonstrated that laboratory measurements of molecular trace gas absorption spectra prior to launch are important for satellite instrument characterization and to validate and improve the spectroscopic database.

  Abstract                 = {{{[}1] Recent investigations report mixing ratios of BrO gas reaching 1 ppb in plume 4 - 7 km downwind of the summit of Soufriere Hills volcano, Montserrat. The detection of BrO in volcanic plumes is potentially important evidence of halogen-catalyzed tropospheric ozone destruction and suggests that volcanoes either directly emit BrO or emit bromine species that are rapidly converted to reactive bromine in volcanic plumes. Species distribution models constrained by volcanic gas and condensate analytical data for arc, rift, and hot spot volcanoes demonstrate that shallow magma degassing generates volcanic gases with ppb to ppm levels of reactive radicals Br, Cl, H, and HO but no significant BrO or ClO. The conversion of volcanic Br and Cl by reaction with ozone in gas-phase catalytic reaction cycles during plume transport can lead to secondary BrO and ClO at mixing ratios of a ppt and higher, possibly approaching a ppb for especially halogen-rich volcanic gases, several kilometers downwind of degassing sources. In general, however, ppb BrO and ClO levels in volcanic plumes several kilometers downwind probably require near-vent, high-temperature reaction of magmatic gases with air and/or in-plume heterogeneous chemical processes involving aerosols during plume transport. These processes oxidize bromine and chlorine in HBr and HCl, giving rise to increased levels of reactive Br, Cl, and HO, in addition to NOx. They can also produce significant amounts of the photochemically active precursors Br-2, BrCl, and Cl-2, which are photolyzable to reactive Br and Cl. The precursors may build up in nighttime volcanic plumes and accelerate ozone destruction and BrO and ClO production after sunrise. Downwind conversion of reactive Br, Cl, H, and HO from volcanic gas sources by catalytic reaction chains to HOBr and HOCl may trigger heterogeneous chemical processes, which are probably essential for sustaining ozone destruction in volcanic plumes. Gas-phase reactions of HBr and HCl with HO in volcanic plumes might also boost BrO and ClO downwind. Thus in-plume processes that generate reactive halogens may contribute significantly to ozone destruction in volcanic plumes. Enhanced levels of HOx and NOx in volcanic emissions may trigger nonhalogen catalytic cycles depleting ozone in tropospheric volcanic plumes.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Recent field observations have shown that the atmospheric plumes of quiescently degassing volcanoes are chemically very active, pointing to the role of chemical cycles involving halogen species and heterogeneous reactions on aerosol particles that have previously been unexplored for this type of volcanic plumes. Key features of these measurements can be reproduced by numerical models such as the one employed in this study. The model shows sustained high levels of reactive bromine in the plume, leading to extensive ozone destruction, that, depending on plume dispersal, can be maintained for several days. The very high concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the volcanic plume reduces the lifetime of the OH radical drastically, so that it is virtually absent in the volcanic plume. This would imply an increased lifetime of methane in volcanic plumes, unless reactive chlorine chemistry in the plume is strong enough to offset the lack of OH chemistry. A further effect of bromine chemistry in addition to ozone destruction shown by the model studies presented here, is the oxidation of mercury. This relates to mercury that has been coemitted with bromine from the volcano but also to background atmospheric mercury. The rapid oxidation of mercury implies a drastically reduced atmospheric lifetime of mercury so that the contribution of volcanic mercury to the atmospheric background might be less than previously thought. However, the implications, especially health and environmental effects due to deposition, might be substantial and warrant further studies, especially field measurements to test this hypothesis.}},

  Abstract                 = {{There is widespread use of passive remote sensing techniques to quantify trace gas column densities in volcanic plumes utilizing scattered sunlight as a light source. Examples include passive DOAS, COSPEC, and the SO2 camera. In order to calculate trace gas concentrations or volcanic emission fluxes, knowledge about the optical path through the plume is necessary. In the past, a straight photon path through the plume has always been assumed although it was known that this is not always true. Here we present the results of model studies conducted specifically to quantify the effects of realistic radiative transfer in and around volcanic plumes on ground-based remote sensing measurements of SO2. The results show that measurements conducted without additional information on average photon paths can be inaccurate under certain conditions, with possible errors spanning more than an order of magnitude. Both over and underestimation of the true column density can occur. Actual errors depend on parameters such as distance between instrument and plume, plume SO2 concentration, plume aerosol load, as well as aerosol conditions in the ambient atmosphere. As an example, a measurement conducted with an SO2 camera is discussed, the results of which can only be correctly interpreted if realistic radiative transfer is considered. Finally, a method is presented which for the first time allows the retrieval of actual average photon paths in spectroscopic (i.e. DOAS) measurements of adequate resolution. By allowing for a wavelength dependent column density during the evaluation of DOAS measurements, we show how radiative transfer effects can be corrected using information inherently available in the measured spectra, thus greatly enhancing the accuracy of DOAS measurements of volcanic emissions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Recent measurements of BrO, NOx, and near-source sulfate in volcanic plumes suggest that volcanic vents might not simply act as point sources of emissions into the troposphere, but may also act as high-temperature reaction sites where mixtures of magmatic and ambient atmospheric gases may combine, giving new and previously unexpected reaction products. The detection of such species demands that a more complex model be developed for the interaction of volcanoes and atmospheres. We show that general thermodynamic models can be applied successfully to volcanic gas equilibria by comparing the results from HSC Chemistry with those from two volcanic gas equilibrium models (Solvgas and Gasmix). Using a thermodynamic model optimized for volcanic gas chemistry (C-O-S-H-F-Cl-Br-I-N-Ar speciation), we show that the volume ratio of atmospheric gas to magmatic gas in a high-temperature mixture is an important parameter of the volcanic plume chemistry, and our results suggest that even small amounts of air (a few \% for an H2O-rich magmatic gas) in the high-temperature mixture are sufficient to yield elevated levels of reactive nitrogen, halogen (Cl, Br, and I), and sulfur species within the volcanic plume. Further modifications of the plume chemistry may also occur due to low-temperature reactions, and chemical schemes for the modification of halogen (Cl, Br, I), nitrogen, and sulfur chemistry are suggested, within the constraints imposed by recent measurements.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Volcanoes have only recently been recognized as a potentially major source of reactive bromine species to the atmosphere, following from the detection of bromine monoxide (BrO) in the plume emitted by Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat. However, BrO is not expected to be emitted in significant quantity from magma, presenting a puzzle regarding its formation. We report here new field measurements of the tropospheric plume emitted by Mt. Etna, Italy, which provide the first direct evidence of fast oxidation of halogen species in a volcanic plume, and lead to an explanation of how BrO is generated from magmatic HBr emissions. We show that the timescale of BrO formation (a few minutes after emission into the atmosphere) is consistent with rapid heterogeneous halogen chemistry involving sulphate aerosol in the plume. The model highlights considerable complexity to the oxidative chemistry of volcanic plumes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

For that purpose we combine new measurements with data that recently became available. It is found that the integrated formation of the radicals is comparable to that of OH radicals in certain situations. However{,} it is argued that the effects of these radicals on the oxidation capacity of the troposphere are not necessarily additive. For instance{,} BrO could be an NO-scavenger.},
