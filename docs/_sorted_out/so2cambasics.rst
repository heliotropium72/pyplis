piSCOPE is a Python based software package which was originally developed for the analysis of \cam data. UV SO2 cameras (e.g. \citep{MoriBurton2006}, \citep{Bluth2007}) were developed to measure \gas fluxes from point sources and have been extensively used at volcanoes (e.g. \citep{MoriBurton2009}, \citep{stebel2015}, \textit{provide some more here}) but also at anthropogenic sources such as power plants (LIT???) and ships (\citep{Prata2014}). The technique underwent a rapid development over the past years both on the instrumental side (LIT) and on the analysis side (e.g. \citep{Kern2010so2Cam}, \citep{luebcke2013}, \citep{Campion2015}, \citep{Peters2015}, \citep{Kern2015}) and can nowadays be considered a standard for monitoring \gas emissions. The technique is based on the Beer-Lambert-Law of absorption and uses narrowband interference filters (typically around 10 nm width) optimised for the retrieval of \gas optical densities ($\tau$) in the emission plume with respect to the background (i.e. $\tau=\ln\frac{I_0}{I}$ where $I_0$ refers to the background intensity and $I$ to the measured intensity after the light passed through the plume). In a standard setup, \gas cameras consist of two filters (in the following denoted with "on" and "off"). The "on" (band) filter is typically situated in a wavelength region around 315 nm ($\lambda_{\text{on}}$) where \gas shows sufficient absorption. The "on" band can be considered the "main" filter of the system as it is very sensitive to \gas absorption. The "off" band filter is situated in a wavelength region close to the on band (typically around 330 nm, $\lambda_{\text{off}}$) where \gas absorption is weak or negligible (compared to the on band) and which is to correct for optical densities ($\tau^*=\ln\frac{I_{\text{off},0}}{I_{\text{off}}}$) due to any spectral broadband variations in the plume which are not caused by SO2 absorption (e.g. due to aerosols). Based on the first order assumption that these broad band optical densities are the same in the on and in the offband regime (i.e. $\tau^*_{\text{on}}\approx\tau^*_{\text{off}}$) a quantity proportional to the SO2 optical density (in the literature often referred to as apparent absorbance or short AA) can simply be retrieved by subtraction of both signals:

.. math::
  AA=\tau_{\text{on}}\,-\,\tau^*=\ln\left(\frac{I_0}{I}\right)_{\text{on}}- \ln\left(\frac{I_0}{I}\right)_{\text{off}}


piSCOPE was developed and tested with focus on the technique of UV SO2 cameras and therefore all explanations (and denotations) in this article are based on the retrieval of \gas fluxes using UV SO2 cameras. However, it is pointed out that piSCOPE (or parts of it) may also be suited to be used for imagery data of other camera types which are based on the same principle (i.e. point source emissions and one or more filters optimised for an arbitrary absorption species). For example, \citep{dekemper2016no2cam} just recently reported the development of a \ce{NO2} camera where they point out the similarities to the technique of UV SO2 cameras. Indeed, even though the measurement principle of this camera is different from UV SO2 cameras, it turns out that the analysis of the data shows large similarities.\\
