piscope example script no. 1

Setup of a example data set

In this script an example data set, recorded on the 16/9/15 7:06-7:22 at 
Mt. Etna is setup. Most of the following example scripts will work on this data 
set. 

A typical analysis setup for plume image data contains information about the
camera (e.g. optics, file naming convention, see also ex0_2_camera_setup.py), 
gas source, the measurement geometry and the wind conditions. These information 
is needs to be generally provided by the user before the analysis. The 
information is stored within a MeasSetup object which can be used as a basis
for further analysis.  
If not all neccessary information is entered, a MeasSetup object will be 
created nonetheless but analysis options might be limited.

Such a MeasSetup object can be used as input for Dataset objects which creates
the analysis environment (i.e. separating files by image type). 

This script shows how to setup a MeasSetup object and create a Dataset object
from it. As example, the first image of the on-band image time series is 
displayed.

The Dataset object created here is also used in script 
ex04_prep_aa_imglist.py which shows how to create an image list displaying
AA images.

    #dimension, pixel size, focal length). Measurement specific parameters
    #(e.g. lon, lat, elev, azim) where defined in the dictinary above and 
    #can be passed as additional keyword dictionary using **geom_cam
