Introduction script 7 - The camera object

This script introduces the camera class which is of fundamental importance
for image import (e.g. separating on, off, dark background images, etc.) and
also for the data analysis as it includes all relevant detector specifications, 
such as number of pixels, pixel size, focal length, etc. 

In this script, the piscope default camera type "ecII" is created manually in
order to illustrate all relevant parameters
